I like that. I was thinking that you would move Bud back to Tri, but this is much better. It keeps forward momentum. And yes, you should take back Tri now. That will make builds easier as we move forward.

Hey, so, Austria seems to want to Lepanto now.   You’re still the ally I want. And I’d like either to cut down Austria quickly or cut down Turkey quickly.

So my reasoning is that I think France is a stronger player than either of us, or at least a more engaged one. I'm getting all this tactical analysis and commentary about the state of the whole board and all that. If I help France, France probably beats me. If we defeat France together, I think we each end up with an even fighting chance.

Speaking of, what are your planned builds? I'm building a fleet in London.

Does France think you’ll be cutting support? Also, Italy has been sending some anti-french things my way. A three-on-one alliance could be good for all of us. Containing Russia may distract both of us if he gets aggressive.

What if I let you into Denmark and I go for Sweden?

PRP (SCD (GER BEL PAR) (ENG BRE POR) (ITA MAR SPA))

Haha ok, glad to get the confirmation. On my end i’ll confirm I am totally anti-french until France is out of the game. I’ve actually ceased communications with France (maybe something we can all do once the stab is clear). I’d like all three of us to get our two builds each together. Then we can look east.
ALY (ENG GER ITA) VSS (FRA)

Why the fleet in berlin btw?

I think we agree to coordinated actions until italy is dealt with. I think you in brest is actually more fair, although less ideal for me. I think we need to pick a victor of the russian-austrian war. Austria is an easier pick because i can take russian dots and austria can help with italy.
PRP (AND (ALY (ENG GER) VSS (ITA)) (SCD (GER BRE)) (ALY (ENG GER AUS) VSS (RUS ITA)))

As far as denmark, the aggression there is fair. But you understand why I'm hesitant to drop down to 4 dots at this point in the game. Fortunately, there's an opportunity to do business here now that you're adjacent to Brest.
REJ (PRP (SCD (GER DEN)))

Yep, Denmark going to Nth.
(ENG FLT DEN) MTO NTH

My plan is to eventually have only fleets along my northwest coast (they're more versatile in that context) and move the armies inland.   See what you can negotiate with Italy, but no matter what they say, I'd be prepared to use your full strength to get Nao into Mao, if that's what you want to do.

So if you're willing to collaborate, I've got some ideas, and would want to hear yours as well. I genuinely think working with me against Italy will be a better long-term strategy for you than working against Italy or alone. Italy is just too strong already. And, as I've said before, I'd like to see an underdog story.
PRP (ALY (ENG GER) VSS (ITA))

So, broadly speaking, the alliance would involve Austria. And that means moving against Russia. We have a huge advantage going into Russia, which takes pressure off of Austria and allows austria to put pressure on Italy.
