We both hate how I vs T just slows us both down, right?  Why do we have to be the slow powers in this game?  I say: we don't!  Let's be unconventional.

I haven't heard back from anyone else yet, so I'm assuming it's going to develop the normal way (me and France fighting in the west while you and Russia fight in the east). It's critical for us to work together so we aren't steamrolled by either France-England or Russia-Turkey, so do you want to agree to an alliance right off the bat?

Absolutely. One of my favorite things about this game is that it can reflect real life history in certain grander strategic considerations, one of which is that, just as would have been the case, neither Germany nor Austria benefits from an antagonistic relationship.

Well... that was harsh. Let me just put a few things straight. Me and Italy is not a thing. I communicated with them the first year about a potential mid game alliance, as I didn't want to be the only one fighting you and Austria. But if you look at their moves, we haven't really done any work together. We haven't even communicated in years. If you look at what they have done so far, you'll see that they are a.) a very bad player or/and b.) are not at all committed to the game. They have basically communicated with nobody, haven't really attacked anyone, and had a good amount of invalid orders. At this point it doesn't make any sense for me to communicate with Italy, since they are a bad player and are going downhill fast. An alliance with you would be much better.
NOT (ALY (RUS))

For the record, I don't think you can hold off me, Austria, and Italy at the same time. Definitely not. And although I have no interest in an alliance with Austria, they will be my second option if you continue to be this bellicose.

You are obviously not allied with Italy. I don't want you to feel like you are being ignored- but ultimately I decided to make the moves that I thought would be best to help me hold onto what I currently have of Italy. A better way for me to handle things would have been to give you a heads up beforehand (for which I apologize). That being said, we would be having a different conversation had I made an explicit commitment towards moving to Naples.

Well, at least I have an idea of who to trust. Obviously, my ideas are subject to change.   I understand your desire to watch behavior before committing to anything. I, personally, am a partner player. I look carefully early in the game for a small group to work with, and then I value loyalty and collaboration. I like to work closely with a tight-knit alliance.   If you prefer to hop and back and forth, or play more of an individual game, then we might not be a good match.   I‚Äôm looking for a loyal ally or two that I can coordinate with and make awesome moves with. Makes the game easier and a lot more fun.

Here's what I'm thinking: I would be on board with you taking the channel (and I'd give France the green light to go ahead with it) if you would agree to bump Nao out of Mao using Wes, and if you'd be open to supporting some anti-English aggression while holding the channel so that I can get on equal footing with you, dot-wise.

I like that. I was thinking that you would move Bud back to Tri, but this is much better. It keeps forward momentum. And yes, you should take back Tri now. That will make builds easier as we move forward.

Also, actually, I don't have anything for Bulgaria to do, and you're guaranteed two dots this turn. Can I take Greece back too? I can bank a build for the future regardless of what happens, and you stay even. You don't really need a build right now.

In terms of what I am telling Austria, I am definitely close with him, and I want him to feel like I‚Äôm not going to stab him, but we‚Äôre almost to the mid game, and cross board alliances work a lot better than neighbor alliances once we get to the mid-game, so I think you can be confident that you‚Äôre the long-term ally I want.

I feel pretty confident that she‚Äôs with you, and that she really wants to see France out of the game.

I would be willing to do that, but as I see it, you have no reason to choose France as an ally over me at this point. So, why me?
(ALY (ENG)) (NOT (ALY (ENG)))

So my reasoning is that I think France is a stronger player than either of us, or at least a more engaged one. I'm getting all this tactical analysis and commentary about the state of the whole board and all that. If I help France, France probably beats me. If we defeat France together, I think we each end up with an even fighting chance.

Speaking of, what are your planned builds? I'm building a fleet in London.

Yeah you have to dislodge. But you held ruhr! And my way wouldn‚Äôt have worked actually. That‚Äôs a stalemate line if you do the same moves except the fleet goes to belgium (i think). Can only be broken if i support it. Of course france could choose to let you in to ruhr as well
RUH HLD

Does France think you‚Äôll be cutting support? Also, Italy has been sending some anti-french things my way. A three-on-one alliance could be good for all of us. Containing Russia may distract both of us if he gets aggressive.
PRP (ALY (ENG GER ITA) VSS (RUS))

What if I let you into Denmark and I go for Sweden?
PRP ((SCD (GER DEN)) (SCD (ENG SWE)))

I'm happy to give you belgium. My idea of the split is you get Bel and Par, I get Bre and Por, and Italy gets Mar and Spa. Obviously this won't all happen this year. But you in Bel makes sense long-term
PRP ((SCD (GER (BEL PAR))) (SCD (ENG (BRE POR))) (SCD (ITA (MAR SPA))))

Haha ok, glad to get the confirmation. On my end i‚Äôll confirm I am totally anti-french until France is out of the game. I‚Äôve actually ceased communications with France (maybe something we can all do once the stab is clear). I‚Äôd like all three of us to get our two builds each together. Then we can look east.
ALY (ENG GER ITA) VSS (FRA)

Why the fleet in berlin btw?
(GER FLT BER) BLD

Well I figured that I'd need at least one more eventually, and that since my whole northern border is coastal a fleet might be better for defending that. But it'll be all armies after this I think.
(GER FLT BER) BLD

We can always play to a three way draw! So does this mean you would be committed to a Russia-Germany-England alliance until the others are dealt with?
YES (ALY (RUS GER ENG) VSS (ITA AUS FRA))

Italy was willing to give up their guess because I requested that Marseilles be left open so I could take Bur, (which I plan to attempt w/ Munich this turn), and Italy agreed.
YES (SCD (GER BUR))

Gotcha. Well i think we have to acknowledge that our alliance would be sort of geographically awkward. I think that makes the alliance stronger actually, but we should be honest with each other about an exit that gives each of us a fair shot in the endgame.
ALY (ENG GER)

I think we agree to coordinated actions until italy is dealt with. I think you in brest is actually more fair, although less ideal for me. I think we need to pick a victor of the russian-austrian war. Austria is an easier pick because i can take russian dots and austria can help with italy.
PRP ((ALY (ENG GER) VSS (ITA)) (SCD (GER BRE)) (ALY (ENG GER AUS) VSS (RUS ITA)))

As far as denmark, the aggression there is fair. But you understand why I'm hesitant to drop down to 4 dots at this point in the game. Fortunately, there's an opportunity to do business here now that you're adjacent to Brest.

My plan is to eventually have only fleets along my northwest coast (they're more versatile in that context) and move the armies inland.   See what you can negotiate with Italy, but no matter what they say, I'd be prepared to use your full strength to get Nao into Mao, if that's what you want to do.

So if you're willing to collaborate, I've got some ideas, and would want to hear yours as well. I genuinely think working with me against Italy will be a better long-term strategy for you than working against Italy or alone. Italy is just too strong already. And, as I've said before, I'd like to see an underdog story.
PRP (ALY (ENG GER) VSS (ITA))

So, broadly speaking, the alliance would involve Austria. And that means moving against Russia. We have a huge advantage going into Russia, which takes pressure off of Austria and allows austria to put pressure on Italy.

Not saying you are the big winner, I'm saying that your misorder was probably a good thing. Before we get into the details of an alliance against Germany, I think it's worth noting that the AI alliance is going to absolutely roll over Russia/Turkey, and so if you take Russia's dots that are easy to take, I think it will be helping Germany/Austria/Italy more than it helps you.

Ok. I don't get why you think I'd build F Brest, but at the very least I appreciate the heads up. At some point I'd like to see you make a decisive move. So far it seems like you've been trying to make moves that both Germany and I agree to.

All great points- and I agree with you on a lot of this. I was very willing to support you to Belgium, but I should have made it more clear that it needed to be an army. I do believe commitment is a good strategy, which is what led me to some admittedly anti-German opening moves.

yeah, I didn't talk to you about going to greece, but ... this isn't chutes and ladders.    However, we're now in really good position to make short work of Russia if we work together.  Thoughts?
PRP (ALY (TUR AUS) VSS (RUS))

I get Greece.  And then we split Italy.  Also, I'd appreciate a boost into Sevastapol, but the rest of Russia would be yours.

I‚Äôd like for you to take Sev, it we need russia to lose more units so that we can finish him before germany is too strong.
PRP (SCD (TUR SEV))

I feel like despite our rocky start you and I have communicated enough that we can declare a full alliance though
ALY (AUS TUR)

I think we can definitely partner up and work together to both our benefit. I also don‚Äôt think it will be particularly difficult to separate our forces. I only have two armies, so I‚Äôm not much of a threat to you and you only have one fleet - so I‚Äôm not worried about you coming after me by yourself. The wild card in all of this is Italy, and he‚Äôs only got one fleet over by me and a French unit in Piedmont.
YES (ALY (TUR AUS))

I‚Äôm moving EMS-ION. Can you support it in with Greece?

would you be interested in going after Italy with me?

Looks like you and germany are allied? Good luck versus england
ALY (FRA GER) VSS (ENG)

Thanks. I would like you to re-consider my proposal. You have become a very powerful country, and if you decide to turn on Italy, there is nothing they can do between the two of us. Right now Turkey and Russia are standing each other off, and there is no immediate threat from either of them for you. Italy will be easy supply centers. I would of course support you into their territory, provided you return the favor. We could work out more details if your interested
PRP (ALY (FRA AUS) VSS (ITA))

so... what do you think?
YES (ALY (FRA AUS) VSS (ITA))

Would you be willing to support Tyr to venice? In return I will support you into one of italys centers in the future. This move will also get my troop out of  Tyr, which, understandably, you don't like
PRP (AUS SUP ((FRA AMY TYR) MTO VEN))

You and Turkey are the most importand. Italy and England are basically out of the game anyways. We can definitly still stop germany, but in order for that to happen you and Turkey are going to have to stop fighting, right away, and work together to get in through germanies back door. They are sending basically all of their units to my hometown, which means they are going to be vulnerable against you guys.
PRP (ALY (FRA AUS TUR) VSS (GER))

it seems germany and France are teaming up against me.  Do you think we can work together against Germany?

Mind if I take Rumania?

Hey England, how are you? I would like to discuss an England/France alliance with you, aimed at taking Germany out quickly. I think if we work together and can trust each other, this could be an amazingly strong alliance. No matter what you decide, I think it would be in both our favor's to leave the English Channel as a DMZ. Let me know if you're interested and we can coordinate moves. Looking forwards to a great game, and good luck!
PRP ((ALY (FRA ENG) VSS (GER)) (DMZ (FRA ENG) (ECH)))

Hello France, I too am interested in moving east with you and I think a channel DMZ is a great idea.  I'll be doing a fairly standard English opening so let's see how russia and germany open to plan tactics next season.

Hi germany! Are you up for Sil as a DMZ? It would be in both of our best interests if we didn't get in a fight early on, as both of our great powers already have a lot to deal with on our sides of the map. Looking forwards to a great game!
PRP (DMZ (RUS GER) (SIL))

Hey Austria! How's it going? I am hoping we can work together on this one. No point getting into any early conflict which will only serve to help everyone else. How do you like to split up the Balkans?
PRP (ALY (TUR))

Hi Turkey! I fully agree that we should stay peaceful with eachother. How do you like the sound of you getting Greece and Bulgaria and I'll go for Romania and Serbia?
(YES (PCE (AUS TUR))) (PRP ((SCD (TUR (GRE BUL))) (SCD (AUS (RUM SER)))))

That sounds good. If we stick together we can get through this early game intact. What's your read on Russia and Italy? Have you heard from them?

Hi Italy, hope you're doing well. I'll be figuring out the situation north of me for the beginning stages so I hope we can keep Pie and Lyo/Wes/Tys  dmz'd if that's ok with you?
