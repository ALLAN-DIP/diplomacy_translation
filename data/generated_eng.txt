English: We both hate how I vs T just slows us both down, right?  Why do we have to be the slow powers in this game?  I say: we don't!  Let's be unconventional.  I have done fun I/T alliances before, but it all depends on making it work.  Let me know if you have any thoughts, or want to just see how the first few seasons roll out, or if there are things you'd like to see from me.

English: Alternatively, pressure R somehow to take away support from Mun.
DAIDE: PRP (PRP (NOT (RUS SUP MUN)))
Translation: This means "This means 'This means that the province does not have a support unit stationed there.'"

English: I haven't heard back from anyone else yet, so I'm assuming it's going to develop the normal way (me and France fighting in the west while you and Russia fight in the east). It's critical for us to work together so we aren't steamrolled by either France-England or Russia-Turkey, so do you want to agree to an alliance right off the bat?
DAIDE: PRP (ALY (GER AUS))
Translation: Hello Germany, are you doing well? I am going to figure out the situation north of me for the beginning stages so I hope we can keep Pie and Lyo/Wes/Tys dmz'd if that's ok with you?

English: Absolutely. One of my favorite things about this game is that it can reflect real life history in certain grander strategic considerations, one of which is that, just as would have been the case, neither Germany nor Austria benefits from an antagonistic relationship.
DAIDE: YES (ALY (AUS GER))
Translation: Yes, I would like to ally with you.

English: I'm feeling pretty solid about working with Turkey, so Russia is the target for now.
DAIDE: ALY (AUS TUR)

English: So it seems like Italy's turned on us. I can support Vienna --> Tyrolia next move if you want
DAIDE: PRP (GER SUP ((AUS AMY VIE) MTO TYR))

English: Sure, a strong England is always a threat to me, so I'd be happy to help annoy them in the North Sea/Scandinavia
DAIDE: YES (ALY (GER FRA) VSS (ENG))
Translation: Yes, Germany and France are allies.

English: But I see you have other plans
DAIDE: NOT (ALY (GER) VSS (ENG))

English: Sigh. We coulda been so good together.
DAIDE: NOT (ALY (AUS TUR))
Translation: This means "Italy does not need help."

English: More than expects: they’re already explicitly asking for Ser-Tri to cut that support
DAIDE: PRP ((TUR AMY SER) MTO TRI)
Translation: The power (type) of unit (province) is moving to (province province) with support.

English: It seems Russia and Turkey have teamed up and, if nothing else, I wouldn't want them to just take over your territory and grow too powerful
DAIDE: ALY (RUS TUR)

DAIDE: PRP (ALY (TUR RUS))
Translation: Hello Russia, are you doing well? I am going to figure out the situation north of me for the beginning stages, so if you don't mind, we can keep Pie and Lyo/Wes/Tys dmz'd.

English: Let’s do it!
DAIDE: YES (ALY (RUS TUR))
Translation: Yes, Russia is willing to ally with you.

English: Austria asked if I am willing to DMZ Gal
DAIDE: PRP (DMZ (RUS AUS) (GAL))
Translation: This means "I am in a DMZ with Russia and Australia."

English: I submitted orders to disband my southern fleet
DAIDE: (RUS FLT BLA) REM
Translation: OVE (RUS FLT BLA) REMOVE

English: So here’s a plan, given we have to change things a little, and requires less of your time: Italy and Austria are at war, but E/G are working together, so we pivot this into a loosely coupled RAT alliance: Austria and I head against Italy, and you make sure to hold off the north, and Austria will help if Germany comes on land as well (I don’t think they will: France is hard enough, and Germany taking on France and Russia at the same time has... a lot of poor historical precedent).  I’ll see if I can take Rum and let you grab Sev back so you can build north, but we’ll come up with something!

DAIDE: NOT (ALY (RUS))
Translation: This means that Italy does not want to ally with Russia.

English: So the thing I notice on this board is that you and I are the only ones thinking about “alliances”.  Everyone else is talking about extremely short term arrangements. “Gunboat with a little bit of talking”, basically.  There is no FG alliance, it’s just that they’re both fighting England... for now.  It’s odd (to me).  I’m all for dynamic play, but you never get anywhere in this game if you only go it alone.
DAIDE: (ALY (TUR RUS)) (NOT (ALY (FRA GER)))
Translation: The DAIDE sentence says "Italy, hope you're doing well. I'll be figuring out the situation north of me for the beginning stages so I hope we can keep Pie and Lyo/Wes/Tys dmz'd if that's ok with you?" In English, this would be translated to "Hello Italy, I hope you're doing well. I will be figuring out the situation north of me for the beginning stages so I hope we can keep Pie and Lyo/Wes/Tys dmz'd if that's ok with you?"

English: Your moves sound fine, but just don’t treat England as an ally - they merely helped you so their attack on Holland would lead to an enemy who wasn’t simultaneously building another unit.
DAIDE: NOT (ALY (ENG))

English: For sure! I’m pretty comfortable with this alliance. The game automatically ends in 1910 so there isn’t really enough time for an outright victory. But working together we should have enough time to whipe everyone else off the board. I’m down to set it to a two way draw once we’ve knocked out everyone else!

English: I think you need to stop the Nwg-Bar move, by doing Nwy-Bar.  At the same time, we need to just give you Tri so you can build another northern fleet.  We can give it back to me next year and if necessary you just disband a rearguard army to make up for it if you’re not picking up another build somewhere else.

DAIDE: YES (DMZ (AUS GER) (TYR))
Translation: Yes, we can keep the DMZ between Australia and Germany dmz'd.

English: Hello czar :) I think we should discuss a few things. A dmz of Silesia and Prussia would benefit us both. Let me know what you think. Also, there are plenty of joint risks to us both, particularly as the game progresses. Let me know if you've got any interest working together

English: Hm I'm getting your messages only in email form. Not to worry. Yes, I did say Prussia in my original message. I think the Baltic sea sounds fair enough as well. Why don't we work together toward those ends? I'm not shocked at the idea Britain might be looking to come for me
DAIDE: YES (DMZ (GER RUS) (PRU BAL))
Translation: Yes, I can build a fleet in Mar.

English: Hi germany! Are you up for Sil as a DMZ? It would be in both of our best interests if we didn't get in a fight early on, as both of our great powers already have a lot to deal with on our sides of the map. Looking forwards to a great game!  -Russia
DAIDE: PRP (DMZ (RUS GER) (SIL))

DAIDE: PRP (DMZ (GER FRA) (BUR))
Translation: 

English: I can do that for sure, though it does mean slowing down potential convoys into England. What does this look like more broadly? Would you be willing to build a fleet in Kiel to take the North Sea? Does this mean you are letting me keep Munich so I can build a fourth fleet next turn?
DAIDE: PRP (((GER FLT KIE) BLD) (SCD (FRA MUN)))

English: In that case, I will keep out of Romania if you do the same, we'll keep it as a DMZ?  I'll admit my promise to help you with Scandinavia was a little optimistic, but do excuse me as I'll blame it on a tad too much Austrian beer.  We should keep an eye on Turkey, but I feel as though an alliance this early on will not leave us in the best of standing with the rest of Europe.
DAIDE: (PRP (DMZ (AUS RUS) (RUM))) (REJ (ALY (AUS RUS) VSS (TUR)))

English: If were going to have an alliance, we should aim for blitzing turkey. It's the power triangle; Austria/Turkey/Russia. Only one of them is going to survive very long. Also, what is your relationship with Italy looking like? Just a note: I am willing to work out an agreement of who gets what part of the balkans, but I am taking Romania. It is essentially part of Russia and leaving it as a DMZ just will not do if Turkey goes for the Black Sea

DAIDE: ALY (AUS TUR)
Translation: is an ally of TUR.

English: Russia won't work with me on this unfortunately
DAIDE: NOT (ALY (RUS))
Translation: This means that Italy does not want to ally with Russia.

DAIDE: PRP (SCD (RUS SEV))
Translation: The SCD is a treaty between the Russian Federation and the Seychelles.

English: Well... that was harsh. Let me just put a few things straight. Me and Italy is not a thing. I communicated with them the first year about a potential mid game alliance, as I didn't want to be the only one fighting you and Austria. But if you look at their moves, we haven't really done any work together. We haven't even communicated in years. If you look at what they have done so far, you'll see that they are a.) a very bad player or/and b.) are not at all committed to the game. They have basically communicated with nobody, haven't really attacked anyone, and had a good amount of invalid orders. At this point it doesn't make any sense for me to communicate with Italy, since they are a bad player and are going downhill fast. An alliance with you would be much better.
DAIDE: NOT (ALY (RUS))
Translation: This means that Italy does not want to ally with Russia.

English: For the record, I don't think you can hold off me, Austria, and Italy at the same time. Definitely not. And although I have no interest in an alliance with Austria, they will be my second option if you continue to be this bellicose.

DAIDE: YES (DMZ (ENG FRA) (ECH))

DAIDE: PRP (RUS SUP ((ENG FLT NTH) MTO DEN))

DAIDE: PRP ((ENG FLT SKA) MTO DEN)

English: Are you comfortable if it goes to Picardy again? I want to try and corner Belgium.

Translation: This means "This means that the province does not belong to the province group."

English: Is he giving you Belgium right now?
DAIDE: YES (SCD (ENG BEL))
Translation: The answer to this question is "Yes," as the SCD alliance has agreed to be allies with the BEL alliance.

English: Hey I just told Russia he can keep Nor for now.
DAIDE: YES (SCD (RUS NWY))
Translation: The answer to this question is "Yes," as the SCD (Russian Navy) is located in NWY.

English: Everything looks good right now. If you sill plan to let Russia keep Norway then I would recommend ordering North Sea-Helgoland Blight, Denmark - Kiel, and Edinburgh-North Sea. Best case scenario, you end up in Helgoland Blight, Kiel, and North Sea and can take Holland in the fall for a total of both Kiel and Holland

English: That's the beauty of leaving three armies on the island lol. I'm willing to give you some builds, but unless I get centers somewhere else that's pretty much the end of my support for FER simply because I won't have the units to do anything useful.

DAIDE: ALY (FRA TUR)
Translation: is allied with ITA

English: You are obviously not allied with Italy. I don't want you to feel like you are being ignored- but ultimately I decided to make the moves that I thought would be best to help me hold onto what I currently have of Italy. A better way for me to handle things would have been to give you a heads up beforehand (for which I apologize). That being said, we would be having a different conversation had I made an explicit commitment towards moving to Naples. And in terms of results, I think you are actually the greatest beneficiary of the moves from last spring, so there is also that 😂 .
DAIDE: NOT (ALY (TUR ITA))

I, personally, am a partner player. I look carefully early in the game for a small group to work with, and then I value loyalty and collaboration. I like to work closely with a tight-knit alliance.   If you prefer to hop and back and forth, or play more of an individual game, then we might not be a good match.   I’m looking for a loyal ally or two that I can coordinate with and make awesome moves with. Makes the game easier and a lot more fun.

English: It’s none of my business, but if you do plan to take Denmark, I strongly recommend you wait until Fall. I think the most important thing for you right now is getting England fully committed against France. If that happens, taking Denmark later will be easy.

English: Yes — agreed upon.
DAIDE: YES (SCD (ITA TRI))
Translation: Yes, I would like to ally with you.

English: I think you should suggest to England that he gets Sweden and St Petersburg, while you get Denmark back. That’s only fair, as you have been a loyal ally in the fight against France and you plan to continue to do that.

English: Excellent. Obviously you have a much better feel for your relationship with England than I do. Just know that France is persuasive, and I’m sure that’s what he’s working on. He stopped talking to me, so I bet he’s trying to turn England. Just keep reassuring England that you want to work with him long-term so he doesn’t succumb to the Dark Side.

DAIDE: PRP ((ITA SUP (SCD (GER NTH))) (SCD (GER ENG)))
Translation: 

English: Here's what I'm thinking: I would be on board with you taking the channel (and I'd give France the green light to go ahead with it) if you would agree to bump Nao out of Mao using Wes, and if you'd be open to supporting some anti-English aggression while holding the channel so that I can get on equal footing with you, dot-wise.  If you don't want to agree to those terms, that's okay, but I would strongly prefer not to see you in the channel in that case.

English: Hi Austria. Nice to meet you, and looking forward to playing as your neighbor.   Hmmmm, I hate playing as Italy. I rarely succeed. Frankly, I’ve recently tried early attacks on Austria, as Italy, AND IT KEEPS TURNING OUT POORLY. I’d really like to play this one as a tight-knit Central Trio if you have any appetite for that. Not sure if I should set up a Lepanto or go west, but I’d be happy to hear your thoughts on it.

DAIDE: PRP (SCD (AUS (GRE VIE SMY)))

English: Also, for my comfort, do you mind if I pick Trieste back up?
DAIDE: PRP (SCD (AUS TRI))
Translation: The speaker is asking for help from their ally in SCD.

English: I like that. I was thinking that you would move Bud back to Tri, but this is much better. It keeps forward momentum. And yes, you should take back Tri now. That will make builds easier as we move forward.
DAIDE: YES (SCD (AUS TRI))
Translation: The answer to this question is "Yes," as the SCD alliance is currently in good standing with the AUS, TRI, and other members of the alliance.

English: Also, actually, I don't have anything for Bulgaria to do, and you're guaranteed two dots this turn. Can I take Greece back too? I can bank a build for the future regardless of what happens, and you stay even. You don't really need a build right now.
DAIDE: PRP (SCD (AUS GRE))

DAIDE: YES (ALY (RUS ITA))
Translation: Yes, I am interested in working with you.

English: Hey, so, Austria seems to want to Lepanto now.   You’re still the ally I want. And I’d like either to cut down Austria quickly or cut down Turkey quickly.   If we decide to take out Austria first, I’d like you to let Austria in to Gal (just tell him this was a mistake). This will make it very hard for him to defend against me.  If we decide to take out Turkey first, bounce Austria, and I’ll open as a traditional Lepanto.  Thoughts?

DAIDE: PRP (ALY (ENG ITA) VSS (FRA))
Translation: The first sentence means "Hello Italy, are you doing well?" The second sentence means "Do you need help?"

Translation: 

English: In terms of what I am telling Austria, I am definitely close with him, and I want him to feel like I’m not going to stab him, but we’re almost to the mid game, and cross board alliances work a lot better than neighbor alliances once we get to the mid-game, so I think you can be confident that you’re the long-term ally I want.

DAIDE: ALY (GER) VSS (FRA)
Translation: The alliance between Germany and France is strong.

Translation: 

English: Haha yeah I suppose. But this game for me is about learning. I’m relatively new to the game, and I volunteered for the study 1) to help out my friend, and 2) to prep for an in-person game I have on August 11. So if I get the right experience from this game and do well in the in-person game (i.e. win bragging rights among my friends), I’ve won MY game. Here is my offer: You bring me along to second place, I vow to help you solo as Italy, and you teach me how you pulled it off. What do you say?
DAIDE: PRP (ALY (ENG ITA))
Translation: Hello Italy, are you doing well? I will be figuring out the situation north of me for the beginning stages, so I hope we can keep Pie and Lyo/Wes/Tys dmz'd if that's okay with you?

English: Well that is a better offer than Germany’s. One of the best offers I’ve ever received. And I really mean it when I say that you’re a joy to play with and a strong ally. I’d be happy to teach you as much as I can.
DAIDE: YES (ALY (ITA ENG))
Translation: Yes, Italy is doing well. I will be figuring out the situation north of me for the beginning stages, so I hope we can keep Pie and Lyo/Wes/Tys dmz'd if that's ok with you.

English: I would still like to work with you
DAIDE: ALY (ENG ITA)

DAIDE: PRP ((SCD (GER DEN)) (SCD (ENG BEL)) (GER SUP ((ENG FLT NTH) MTO BEL)))

English: France would love for me to be an ally in taking you out of the game over the next couple of years. They’ve been talking about convincing russia to help with the takedown.
DAIDE: PRP (ALY (FRA ENG RUS) VSS (GER))
Translation: Hello France, I hope you're doing well. I am going to be figuring out the situation north of me for the beginning stages, so I hope we can keep Pie and Lyo/Wes/Tys dmz'd if that's okay with you?

English: I would be willing to do that, but as I see it, you have no reason to choose France as an ally over me at this point. So, why me?
DAIDE: (ALY (ENG)) (NOT (ALY (ENG)))
Translation: This means "Aly (Eng) is not (Aly (Eng))".

English: So my reasoning is that I think France is a stronger player than either of us, or at least a more engaged one. I'm getting all this tactical analysis and commentary about the state of the whole board and all that. If I help France, France probably beats me. If we defeat France together, I think we each end up with an even fighting chance.

English: Yeah you have to dislodge. But you held ruhr! And my way wouldn’t have worked actually. That’s a stalemate line if you do the same moves except the fleet goes to belgium (i think). Can only be broken if i support it. Of course france could choose to let you in to ruhr as well
DAIDE: RUH HLD
Translation: Hold

English: Does France think you’ll be cutting support? Also, Italy has been sending some anti-french things my way. A three-on-one alliance could be good for all of us. Containing Russia may distract both of us if he gets aggressive.
DAIDE: PRP (ALY (ENG GER ITA) VSS (RUS))
Translation: Hello, England, I hope you're doing well. I'll be figuring out the situation north of me for the beginning stages so I hope we can keep Pie and Lyo/Wes/Tys dmz'd if that's ok with you?

English: What if I let you into Denmark and I go for Sweden?
DAIDE: PRP ((SCD (GER DEN)) (SCD (ENG SWE)))
Translation: The first sentence means "Do you need help? I could build a fleet in (Germany/Denmark)". The second sentence means "I could build a fleet in (Sweden/England)".

English: I'm happy to give you belgium. My idea of the split is you get Bel and Par, I get Bre and Por, and Italy gets Mar and Spa. Obviously this won't all happen this year. But you in Bel makes sense long-term
DAIDE: PRP ((SCD (GER (BEL PAR))) (SCD (ENG (BRE POR))) (SCD (ITA (MAR SPA))))
Translation: 

English: Haha ok, glad to get the confirmation. On my end i’ll confirm I am totally anti-french until France is out of the game. I’ve actually ceased communications with France (maybe something we can all do once the stab is clear). I’d like all three of us to get our two builds each together. Then we can look east.
DAIDE: ALY (ENG GER ITA) VSS (FRA)
Translation: The alliance between England and Italy is strong.

English: Why the fleet in berlin btw?
DAIDE: (GER FLT BER) BLD
Translation: 

English: Well I figured that I'd need at least one more eventually, and that since my whole northern border is coastal a fleet might be better for defending that. But it'll be all armies after this I think.
DAIDE: (GER FLT BER) BLD
Translation: 

English: We can always play to a three way draw! So does this mean you would be committed to a Russia-Germany-England alliance until the others are dealt with?
DAIDE: YES (ALY (RUS GER ENG) VSS (ITA AUS FRA))
Translation: YES (ALY (RUS GER ENG) VSS (ITA AUS FRA))

English: Italy was willing to give up their guess because I requested that Marseilles be left open so I could take Bur, (which I plan to attempt w/ Munich this turn), and Italy agreed.
DAIDE: YES (SCD (GER BUR))
Translation: Yes, I will help you.

English: Gotcha. Well i think we have to acknowledge that our alliance would be sort of geographically awkward. I think that makes the alliance stronger actually, but we should be honest with each other about an exit that gives each of us a fair shot in the endgame.
DAIDE: ALY (ENG GER)
Translation: Hello Germany, are you doing well? I am going to figure out the situation north of me for the beginning stages. If that is okay with you, I could build a fleet in Mar.

English: I think we agree to coordinated actions until italy is dealt with. I think you in brest is actually more fair, although less ideal for me. I think we need to pick a victor of the russian-austrian war. Austria is an easier pick because i can take russian dots and austria can help with italy.
DAIDE: PRP ((ALY (ENG GER) VSS (ITA)) (SCD (GER BRE)) (ALY (ENG GER AUS) VSS (RUS ITA)))
Translation: 

English: As far as denmark, the aggression there is fair. But you understand why I'm hesitant to drop down to 4 dots at this point in the game. Fortunately, there's an opportunity to do business here now that you're adjacent to Brest.
DAIDE: NOT (YES (SCD (GER DEN)))
Translation: This means "No, I do not want to accept this alliance."

English: I'm wondering if these defenses involve you not supporting Eng, which would kind of half-confirm the plot.
DAIDE: PRP (NOT (ENG SUP ECH))
Translation: This means "I do not agree", or "I do not support".

English: They do involve me not supporting Eng.
DAIDE: PRP (NOT (ENG SUP ECH))

English: Ok do I have your supports?
DAIDE: GER SUP ENG
Translation: MTO province Move

English: Yep, Denmark going to Nth.
DAIDE: (ENG FLT DEN) MTO NTH
Translation: 

English: My plan is to eventually have only fleets along my northwest coast (they're more versatile in that context) and move the armies inland.   See what you can negotiate with Italy, but no matter what they say, I'd be prepared to use your full strength to get Nao into Mao, if that's what you want to do. (And in case it's not obvious, it's what *I* think you should do)
DAIDE: PRP ((ENG FLT NAO) MTO MAO)
Translation: The player is asking if the other player needs help with moving a unit from one province to another.

English: To that end, I can support Eng  and Bre holding.
DAIDE: PRP (GER SUP ((ECH HLD) (BRE HLD)))
Translation: The player is requesting support to hold a province in Germany and also support to move a province in Belgium.

English: wait, I'm confused. What? The unit displaced from Nth. You haven't given retreat orders yet. Go to Edi?
DAIDE: (ENG FLT NTH) RTO EDI
Translation: 

English: So if you're willing to collaborate, I've got some ideas, and would want to hear yours as well. I genuinely think working with me against Italy will be a better long-term strategy for you than working against Italy or alone. Italy is just too strong already. And, as I've said before, I'd like to see an underdog story.
DAIDE: PRP (ALY (ENG GER) VSS (ITA))
Translation: Hello England, are you doing well? I'll be figuring out the situation north of me for the beginning stages so I hope we can keep Gibraltar and Malta dmz'd if that's ok with you?

English: So, broadly speaking, the alliance would involve Austria. And that means moving against Russia. We have a huge advantage going into Russia, which takes pressure off of Austria and allows austria to put pressure on Italy.

Translation: Hello England, are you doing well? I'll be figuring out the situation north of me for the beginning stages so I hope we can keep Pie and Lyo/Wes/Tys dmz'd if that's ok with you?

English: I'm supporting paris from brest
DAIDE: ENG SUP PAR
Translation: We both want to help each other, but we need to be careful not to slow each other down. Let's work together and see what we can do.

English: So, here's my pitch: I have been on both sides of the deal when Austria, Italy, and Russia decide that everything would be simpler if there wasn't a Turkey. Every time, things have indeed been simpler for A/I/R. So, whaddya think? Wanna simplify our game?
DAIDE: PRP (ALY (AUS RUS) VSS (TUR))
Translation: The player wants to ally with Russia.

English: I assume the Greece swap wasn't negotiated?
DAIDE: YES (GRE)
Translation: Yes, I would like to help.

English: No. No it was not. There are some heated discussions happening.
DAIDE: NOT (YES (GRE))
Translation: This means "No, I do not want to do that."

English: I'm building army Sebastopol for the obvious defense - assuming you do build in Trieste, will take steps to demilitarize that border (no move to Galicia or otherwise in your direction, cooperate on Smyrna, moving units away as soon as possible)
DAIDE: ((RUS AMY SEV) BLD) (PRP (DMZ (RUS AUS) (GAL)))
Translation: 

English: So you built F LON and France built F BRE, eh? Trouble in paradise?
DAIDE: ((ENG FLT LON) BLD) ((FRA FLT BRE) BLD)

DAIDE: PRP (ALY (ENG AUS) VSS (RUS))
Translation: The power of England and Australia is working together.

English: Are you and Italy still good after the surprise in Trieste?
DAIDE: ALY (AUS ITA)

DAIDE: ALY (AUS RUS)
Translation: Hello Russia, are you doing well? I am going to figure out the situation north of me for the beginning stages. If that is okay with you, I could build a fleet in Mar.

English: However nothing bad came if it and I still think we can work together your thoughts?
DAIDE: PRP (ALY (TUR AUS))
Translation: Hello Australia, are you doing well? I will be figuring out the situation north of me for the beginning stages, so I hope we can keep Pie and Lyo/Wes/Tys dmz'd if that's okay with you?

DAIDE: (FRA FLT BRE) BLD
Translation: 

English: Maybe you can ask for Trieste back?
DAIDE: PRP (PRP (SCD (AUS TRI)))
Translation: The speaker is asking their ally if they need help. If the ally says yes, the speaker will build a fleet in their province near their ally.

DAIDE: ALY (FRA ENG GER) VSS (ITA)
Translation: The alliance between France and Italy is strong.

DAIDE: PRP (SCD (RUS RUM))
Translation: The speaker is asking if the other person needs help. If the other person says yes, the speaker will build a fleet in Russia and Romania.

DAIDE: ALY (TUR RUS)

DAIDE: PRP (DMZ (ENG FRA) (ECH))
Translation: "I am DMZing (engaging in a diplomatic relationship with) France."

English: Makes sense. I agree, a DMZ is good for us both. I know that getting armies off of the island is pretty important for you. Depending on how it plays out we could talk about Belgium. Any thoughts on your other neighbors Germany and Russia?
DAIDE: YES (DMZ (FRA ENG) (ECH))
Translation: 

English: Not saying you are the big winner, I'm saying that your misorder was probably a good thing. Before we get into the details of an alliance against Germany, I think it's worth noting that the AI alliance is going to absolutely roll over Russia/Turkey, and so if you take Russia's dots that are easy to take, I think it will be helping Germany/Austria/Italy more than it helps you.
DAIDE: ALY (AUS ITA) VSS (RUS TUR)
Translation: The first sentence in DAIDE is "Aly (AUS ITA) VSS (RUS TUR)." The second sentence in English is "Alison (Australia) is supporting Russia (Turkey)."

English: Ok so guarantee based on Russian collaboration. So you don't think Russia and Germany are friends anymore? I suppose they don't have many favors to offer one another
DAIDE: ALY (RUS GER)
Translation: Hello Russia, are you doing well? I am going to figure out the situation north of me for the beginning stages. If that is okay with you, I could build a fleet in Mar.

English: Yeah I think that they are not working together but are simply coexisting
DAIDE: NOT (ALY (RUS GER))
Translation: This means "Italy does not ally with Russia."

English: Ok. I don't get why you think I'd build F Brest, but at the very least I appreciate the heads up. At some point I'd like to see you make a decisive move. So far it seems like you've been trying to make moves that both Germany and I agree to.
DAIDE: NOT ((FRA FLT BRE) BLD)
Translation: 

English: All great points- and I agree with you on a lot of this. I was very willing to support you to Belgium, but I should have made it more clear that it needed to be an army. I do believe commitment is a good strategy, which is what led me to some admittedly anti-German opening moves. I'm not saying you have not shown commitment, after all we have an excellent DMZ in the channel, but it does bug me a bit that I cannot identify something you have done to antagonize Germany.
DAIDE: (ALY (FRA ENG)) (DMZ (FRA ENG) (ECH))

English: Updated my orders to support you
DAIDE: GER SUP ITA
Translation: The GER unit will support the ITA unit in a move.

English: I can’t agree to a deal where he keeps the North Sea. I just can’t have two armies sitting around doing nothing to be this guys friend.
DAIDE: NOT (YES (SCD (ENG NTH)))
Translation: This means "No, I do not want to accept this alliance."

English: Understood. We have to see what this Anglo-German alliance holds.
DAIDE: ALY (ENG GER)
Translation: Hello Germany, are you doing well? I am going to figure out the situation north of me for the beginning stages. If that is okay with you, I could build a fleet in Mar.

Translation: Hello Germany, are you doing well? I am going to figure out the situation north of me for the beginning stages. If that is okay with you, I could build a fleet in Mar.

English: With Italy? I don’t think we were ever really allied
DAIDE: NOT (ALY (ENG ITA))
Translation: This means "Italy does not need help."

English: We’re in it together
DAIDE: ALY (ENG GER)
Translation: Hello Germany, are you doing well? I am going to figure out the situation north of me for the beginning stages. If that is okay with you, I could build a fleet in Mar.

English: Not entirely. He did not move F Nap - Ion
DAIDE: NOT ((ITA FLT NAP) MTO ION)
Translation: This means "I don't think that Italy should send a fleet to Naples"

English: What if we all just ganged up. Even if I lose knowing I helped beat the best player in the world would be dope lol
DAIDE: PRP (ALY (GER TUR FRA RUS ENG ITA) VSS (AUS))
Translation: Hello Germany, I hope you're doing well. I am considering building a fleet in Mar.

English: Yes, why is Italy so strongly joined at the hip with Austria? It seems unlikely that we will be able to pry him away unfortunately
DAIDE: ALY (ITA AUS)
Translation: Hello Australia, are you doing well? I am going to figure out the situation north of me for the beginning stages so I hope we can keep the DMZ dmz'd if that's okay with you?

English: Or are you working with Austria?
DAIDE: ALY (TUR)
Translation: wants to ally with ITA

English: I'm not working with Austria, I'm just not doing anything.
DAIDE: NOT (ALY (TUR))
Translation: This means "Italy does not need help."

English: Okay, so rum sound good! I can follow up with my troops from mainland turkey as well before winter. What is your side of this?
DAIDE: YES (RUM)

English: Ok great. I'm supporting with the fleet as well.

English: But I’m supporting you from Ukraine
DAIDE: GER SUP ((TUR AMY SEV) MTO RUM)

English: We have a break over the weekend but you still want me to support you into Bud?
DAIDE: PRP (TUR SUP ((GER AMY GAL) MTO BUD))
Translation: The power is GER, the province is BUD, and the unit type is AMY.

English: I’m thinking I take Serb and you can have Greece if that’s cool with you?
DAIDE: PRP ((SCD (GER SER)) (SCD (TUR GRE)))
Translation: The first sentence means "Do you need help? I could build a fleet in (country)?" The second sentence means "I could build a fleet in (country) and (country)."

English: Potentially! As long as we can agree to some broader armistice. I don’t want to focus on fighting you. We just toppled Austria together and plus Turkey is mega hard to take with out a Mediterranean fleet... but we could cause problems for each other if we don’t work something out.
DAIDE: PRP (PCE (GER TUR))
Translation: The power of Germany is strong.

English: I’ve set my order to Mun -> Burg
DAIDE: (GER AMY MUN) MTO BUR
Translation: 

English: Austria and Italy are allying FYI
DAIDE: ALY (AUS ITA)
Translation: is an ally of FRA.

English: It's looking like the Russians and the Turks are trying a Juggernaut.
DAIDE: ALY (RUS TUR)
Translation: is an ally of TUR.

English: If they do that, we desperately need to be strongly allied with the Austrians, otherwise they'll roll us over, hard.
DAIDE: PRP (ALY (GER ITA AUS) VSS (RUS TUR))
Translation: The player wants to ally with Italy, but also wants to keep their Russian and Turkish allies dmz'd.

English: Our interests are aligned in both sides of the map, so let's just coordinate closely
DAIDE: ALY (ITA GER)
Translation: Hello Germany, are you doing well? I am going to figure out the situation north of me for the beginning stages so I hope we can keep Pie and Lyo/Wes/Tys dmz'd if that's ok with you?

DAIDE: PRP (ALY (ITA AUS GER) VSS (RUS TUR))
Translation: Hi Australia, Germany, Russia, hope you're doing well. I'll be figuring out the situation north of me for the beginning stages so I hope we can keep Pie and Lyo/Wes/Tys dmz'd if that's ok with you?

English: Yeah, maybe they predicted that you'd think they were lying to me? Regardless, bad move on their part in any case, especially since you have a build.
DAIDE: (ITA FLT ROM) BLD
Translation: 

English: No idea, the y apparently aren't interested in working with you anymore. I'm quite frankly pulling my hair over this, it's the worst possible move.
DAIDE: NOT (ALY (AUS))
Translation: This means that Italy does not want to be allied with Australia.

English: Well the English are a little miffed that I didn't move last season, but still, I see no reason not to work with them for the time being.
DAIDE: ALY (GER)
Translation: is an ally of TUR ITA.

English: Are you coordinating with the Turks? I think that for the time being that would be a good idea.
DAIDE: PRP (ALY (ITA))

DAIDE: PRP ((GER AMY TYR) SUP ((GER AMY APU) MTO VEN))
Translation: 

English: We're the only ones I trust to understand how unlikely a Solo is, and you seem interested in cooperation, so I'll honestly put all my chips under your bag and defend you until the end if you're willing to do the same with me.
DAIDE: PRP (ALY (ITA AUS))
Translation: Hello Australia, are you doing well? I will be figuring out the situation north of me for the beginning stages so I hope we can keep Pie and Lyo/Wes/Tys dmz'd if that's ok with you?

English: I haven’t been told to do a Lepanto yet, who said that? And yes I would like peace on our front, I could have a three front war at any time so it would be great if you and I did not fight. Where would you expand to then?
DAIDE: YES (PCE (AUS ITA))
Translation: Yes, I would like to ally with you.

English: Would like to get your thoughts on your other moves? Is A Budapest going to Serbia, and is A Vienna going to Galicia or allowing Russia in?
DAIDE: ((AUS AMY BUD) MTO SER) ((AUS AMY VIE) MTO GAL)
Translation: 

English: I 100% do not want to fight you. I agree that Austria Italy is a war that often happens but never really works out for either side. We would just stagnate until russia or turkey or both took us out.
DAIDE: YES (PCE (AUS ITA))
Translation: Yes, I would like to ally with you.

English: I’d like to propose that you and I go full alliance
DAIDE: PRP (ALY (AUS ITA))
Translation: Hello Italy, are you doing well? I will be figuring out the situation north of me for the beginning stages, so I hope we can keep Pie and Lyo/Wes/Tys dmz'd if that's okay with you?

English: I'm game for the Lepanto, and it seems Germany is on board as well
DAIDE: YES (ALY (ITA AUS GER) VSS (TUR))
Translation: Yes, Italy, Germany, and Turkey are allies.

English: With the build in Marseilles, France's goals are quite transparent
DAIDE: (FRA FLT MAR) BLD
Translation: "I can build a fleet in Mar."

English: Also Germany and France are allied, however Germany is also willing to help us out
DAIDE: ALY (GER FRA)
Translation: is an ally of ITA

English: Germany and France allying is not ideal for me, but I feel confident in observing that Turkey and Russia are allied as well
DAIDE: (ALY (GER FRA)) (ALY (TUR RUS))
Translation: Hello Germany, I hope you're doing well. I am going to be figuring out the situation north of me for the beginning stages so I hope we can keep Pie and Lyo/Wes/Tys dmz'd if that's ok with you?

English: Would appreciate you helping me to hold in Greece, and we'll need whatever help from Germany that we can get
DAIDE: YES (AUS SUP (GRE HLD))
Translation: Yes, I have ahold of a province in Greece.

English: I can still support A Serbia - Buglaria as well, if that helps
DAIDE: PRP ((AUS AMY SER) MTO BUL)
Translation: The player would like to move their unit from their province in Amaya to their province in Bul.

English: However I view you as my most important ally which is why I’m asking you about all this
DAIDE: ALY (AUS ITA)
Translation: is an ally of FRA.

English: What are you thinking? F Alb S A Gre H would be appreciated in my perspective
DAIDE: PRP ((AUS FLT ALB) SUP (GRE HLD))
Translation: 

English: Do you have Germany on your side as well?
DAIDE: ALY (GER)
Translation: is an ally of TUR ITA.

English: England seems to be a bit pessimistic, which is probably justified facing a France-Germany coalition
DAIDE: ALY (FRA GER) VSS (ENG)
Translation: The DAIDE translation for "aly" would be "Italy", the DAIDE translation for "vss" would be "support", and the DAIDE translation for "eng" would be "support".

English: Yes a cease fire sounds perfect, I need to handle Turkey.
DAIDE: YES (PCE (AUS ITA))
Translation: Yes, I would like to ally with you.

English: If you can capture St Petersburg from Germany while holding on to Moscow
DAIDE: PRP ((SCD (AUS STP)) (MOS HLD) (ALY (AUS ITA TUR FRA) VSS (GER)))
Translation: 

English: Hahaha Italy is one of the weaker powers on the board. I need to be proactive in seeking allies, even if it means accepting being the junior partner. And Russia is the natural first choice
DAIDE: PRP (ALY (ITA RUS))
Translation: Hello Russia, are you doing well? I am going to figure out the situation north of me for the beginning stages, so if you don't mind, we can keep Pie and Lyo/Wes/Tys dmz'd.

English: Well considering the opening, I’d say I’m anti France. I will be working with Germany against France. Pressure in piedmont and Med would be appreciated. You’re bound to pick up a few dots if Germany and I work well against France.
DAIDE: ALY (ENG GER) VSS (FRA)
Translation: The English translation would be:

English: I'm pretty mad at France as well after they built a fleet in Marseilles
DAIDE: (FRA FLT MAR) BLD
Translation: "I can build a fleet in Mar."

English: You didn't hear this from me, but it seems the Germany-France alliance is breaking down
DAIDE: NOT (ALY (GER FRA))
Translation: This means "Italy does not want to ally with Germany."

English: Makes sense that Black Sea was prearranged - are they on board with occupying it now?
DAIDE: YES (SCD (RUS BLA))
Translation: The answer to this question is "Yes," as the SCD (Russian Black Sea Fleet) is located in the Black Sea.

English: For what it's worth, I will build a fleet in Rome as you had requested - as it is necessary to cover France
DAIDE: YES ((ITA FLT ROM) BLD)
Translation: 

English: If you are willing to build an army in Con as well, I would take that as a strong indicator of your desire for cooperation, but would understand if you feel that is not an option for you
DAIDE: PRP ((TUR AMY CON) BLD)
Translation: The power is accepting the alliance.

English: I think you need an army in Venice, my friend.
DAIDE: PRP ((ITA AMY VEN) BLD)
Translation: The player is asking if the other player needs help with building a fleet in Italy.

English: I’m gonna roll the dice and build A Con.
DAIDE: (TUR AMY CON) BLD
Translation: The Turanian army is moving to conquer the country.

English: Well, I see you got cold feet regarding the A Con build
DAIDE: NOT ((TUR AMY CON) BLD)
Translation: 

English: I wouldn't be able to support you as much from Greece as I was in the past (since even if I were to somehow reclaim it, it would be with a fleet instead of an army), but I would still be willing to put pressure on Trieste to help you claim Serbia/Budapest
DAIDE: PRP (ITA SUP (SCD (TUR (SER BUD))))
Translation: The player is requesting support from their ally in Italy to hold a province in the Balkans.

English: I agree.  We certainly can and should work together.
DAIDE: YES (ALY (TUR ITA))
Translation: Yes, Italy is doing well. I will be figuring out the situation north of me for the beginning stages, so I hope we can keep Pie and Lyo/Wes/Tys dmz'd if that's ok with you.

DAIDE: (ITA FLT ION) SUP (GRE HLD)

English: A Ven S F Alb - Tri A ION C A Nap - Alb would be the fastest way to ramp up the pressure on Austria
DAIDE: PRP (((ITA AMY VEN) SUP ((ITA FLT ALB) MTO TRI)) ((ITA FLT ION) CVY (ITA AMY NAP) CTO ALB))
Translation: 

English: Let's try to coordinate with France and Austria to prevent a German victory, but might be a lost cause at this point
DAIDE: PRP (ALY (ITA TUR) VSS (GER))
Translation: The power of Italy and Germany is equal, so they can ally with each other.

English: We need to prop up Austria- that means supporting him to hold in Vienna, etc.
DAIDE: PRP ((TUR ITA) SUP (VIE HLD))
Translation: The DAIDE translation would be: "I (TUR) offer (SUP) my (HLD) hold to you."

English: And then try to use Rum to go to Galicia
DAIDE: PRP ((TUR AMY RUM) MTO GAL)
Translation: 

English: Adriatic should support Venice to hold.
DAIDE: PRP ((ITA FLT ADR) SUP (VEN HLD))
Translation: The player is requesting support to hold a province in Italy.

English: And ask for Austrian help in Tyrol.
DAIDE: PRP (PRP (AUS SUP TYR))
Translation: This means "This is a message from the province of (power type) to the province of (province type)."

English: Makes sense with Greece, is Aegean going to the Ionian then?
DAIDE: (TUR FLT AEG) MTO ION
Translation: 

English: no.  no need.
DAIDE: NOT ((TUR FLT AEG) MTO ION)
Translation: This means "No, I don't want to move my unit to Ion."

English: Suggest we demilitarize Piedmont and Gulf of Tyrolia. I won't be too happy if you move to Spain sc or build a fleet in Piedmont either
DAIDE: PRP (DMZ (ITA FRA) (MAR TYR))
Translation: "Hi Italy, hope you're doing well. I'll be figuring out the situation north of me for the beginning stages so I hope we can keep Pie and Lyo/Wes/Tys dmz'd if that's ok with you?"

English: What's with the fleet build in Marseilles?
DAIDE: (FRA FLT MAR) BLD
Translation: "I can build a fleet in Mar."

DAIDE: PRP (DMZ (ITA FRA) (LYO TYS))
Translation: "Hi Italy, hope you're doing well. I'll be figuring out the situation north of me for the beginning stages so I hope we can keep Pie and Lyo/Wes/Tys dmz'd if that's ok with you?"

English: I am willing to concede it to you if you cooperate elsewhere
DAIDE: PRP (SCD (FRA VEN))
Translation: The province of France is accepting your request for help.

English: I would require the return of Venice as a precondition to any cooperation against Germany
DAIDE: PRP ((SCD (ITA VEN)) (ALY (ITA FRA) VSS (GER)))
Translation: 

English: Naturally, attacking Rome or Naples would also rule this out
DAIDE: NOT (ALY (ITA FRA))
Translation: This means "Italy is not an ally of France."

English: Did you actually hear from someone that a Juggernaut is happening or did you just get that from reading the board
DAIDE: ALY (RUS TUR)
Translation: is an ally of TUR.

English: That's a good joke. That basically confirms it though, even if it weren't already. They're working together.
DAIDE: ALY (RUS TUR)
Translation: is an ally of TUR.

English: Yes
DAIDE: ALY (RUS TUR)
Translation: is an ally of TUR.

English: Lol especially with that fleet build
DAIDE: (TUR FLT SMY) BLD
Translation: 

English: Yeah I didn’t believe that turkey wanted to go against Russia but it looks like he actually does
DAIDE: NOT (ALY (TUR))
Translation: This means "Italy does not need help."

English: Ukr into War, final answer
DAIDE: PRP (GER SUP ((AUS AMY UKR) MTO WAR))
Translation: 

English: I was really hoping to secure Warsaw for myself, truth be told, unless you intend to stay friends with the Turks once Russia's finished off, but then again I'm not under any specific threat so I suppose you can have it.
DAIDE: YES (SCD (AUS WAR))
Translation: The speaker agrees to support the SCD alliance.

English: Alright, from there Moscow is yours, I'll take St. Petersburg and Sweden and you'll take Romania and Sevastopol, as well as, of course, whatever you can get off the Turks.
DAIDE: YES ((SCD (AUS MOS)) (SCD (GER (STP SWE))) (SCD (AUS (RUM SEV))))
Translation: 

English: Once again I feel like allying with you is the best move because you talk more than anyone else hahaha
DAIDE: ALY (AUS)
Translation: wants to ally with TUR ITA.

English: What is your stance on me taking War
DAIDE: YES (SCD (AUS WAR))
Translation: The answer to this question is "Yes," as the SCD alliance is in agreement.

English: I would certainly prefer having Warsaw myself, and eventually I would prefer to get it from you, but if you think that it'd be better for you to have it I will support that.
DAIDE: YES (SCD (AUS WAR))
Translation: The answer to this question is "Yes," as the SCD alliance is in agreement.

English: Alright, the Turkish/Russian Alliance is pretty thoroughly ruined at this point, think it's safe to double down with the Italians to crush them now.
DAIDE: (NOT (ALY (TUR RUS))) (PRP (ALY (GER AUS) VSS (ITA)))
Translation: 

English: Yeah plus they have zero allies
DAIDE: NOT (ALY (AUS GER FRA ENG))
Translation: This means that the country of Albania does not want to ally with either of the other two countries.

English: I’m gonna reach out to england about seeing if they would take St P, even though it would be selfish and short sighted of him it might be enticing enough for him to do it
DAIDE: PRP (SCD (ENG STP))
Translation: The speaker is asking if the other person needs help. If the other person says yes, the speaker will build a fleet in England.

English: Monday. I can check again if you'd like, but in any case siding with the Turks is a sucker's bet for you. Once Russia's gone they have nowhere to expand and they're at your back, and siding with them will rapidly erode Italy's willingness to side with you.
DAIDE: NOT (ALY (ITA))
Translation: This means "Italy does not need help."

English: I'm all in on your side here but my navy's on the other side of the map and armies can only touch Turkey and shore you up if I enter your personal space, so to speak.
DAIDE: ALY (GER)
Translation: is an ally of TUR ITA.

English: Hello and good evening! You and I have much to talk about, and if we don't get certain things sorted out and understood between us I'm afraid that any conflict that might arise would surely sink us both.  First thing's first, I would greatly prefer if we could keep  Silesia and Prussia demilitarized, as well as Bohemia should such a situation arise.
DAIDE: PRP (DMZ (GER RUS) (SIL PRU BOH))
Translation: The DMZ between Germany and Russia is open for business.

English: Also, you working with the Turks? I can help hasten Austria's demise if you are.
DAIDE: ALY (RUS TUR)
Translation: is an ally of TUR.

English: It's been pretty limited, made some agreements regarding Belgium but aside from that they've been cagey
DAIDE: YES (BEL)
Translation: Yes, I would like to help.

English: You’re in tight with France and I haven’t seen anything to make me think otherwise. Unfortunate that Russia messed up. I hope we can work together against France. I can make a great ally.

English: let's work together
DAIDE: PRP (ENG GER)
Translation: Hello Germany, are you doing well? I am going to figure out the situation north of me for the beginning stages. If that is okay with you, I could build a fleet in Mar.

DAIDE: ALY (TUR RUS)
Translation: Hello Russia, are you doing well? I am going to figure out the situation north of me for the beginning stages. If that is okay with you, I could build a fleet in Mar.

English: So I take it you and the Russians aren't cooperating anymore?
DAIDE: NOT (ALY (TUR RUS))
Translation: This means "Italy does not want to ally with Russia."

English: If you’re n attacking Moscow or anything, I’d appreciate you to support me to hold in Ukraine.
DAIDE: PRP (GER SUP (UKR HLD))
Translation: The German province is supporting the Ukrainian hold.

English: I've got no big plans, but I could certainly help you hold. Couldn't you use Sevastopol though?
DAIDE: YES (GER SUP (UKR HLD))
Translation: Yes, I can provide a unit to help hold your province.

English: Hey Germany. "Natural suited antagonists"? I beg to differ. I personally think that over here in the west, a France/Germany alliance is the strongest, preferably taking out England ASAP. What do you think?
DAIDE: PRP (ALY (FRA GER) VSS (ENG))
Translation: Hello Germany, are you doing well? I could build a fleet in Mar if you need help.

English: So you're headed to Belgium now from the Channel, yes?
DAIDE: (FRA FLT ECH) MTO BEL
Translation: The French fleet is heading to Belgium.

English: Yes, it's fine. Sooo, ig the game is in grace period, so I was wondering what you builds were looking like. I will build a fleet in Bre and if you build a fleet in Kiel, the 4 combined fleets should be more than enough to take out britain, and we shouldn't have to build anything else in that regard.
DAIDE: ((FRA FLT BRE) BLD) (PRP ((GER FLT KIE) BLD))

DAIDE: (GER AMY MUN) BLD
Translation: 

English: Absolutely. My fleet in Denmark wouldn't be doing anything otherwise. Are you moving in with Piedmont or Tyrolia? Because if it's not Tyrolia I can support that to stay put, just in case the Austrians get antsy.
DAIDE: (YES (GER SUP ((FRA FLT BEL) MTO NTH)))
Translation: Yes, I am willing to support a move by your province through my province with my fleet in Bel.

DAIDE: YES ((FRA AMY PAR) BLD)

DAIDE: PRP (ALY (TUR AUS) VSS (RUS))

English: I think we can definitely partner up and work together to both our benefit. I also don’t think it will be particularly difficult to separate our forces. I only have two armies, so I’m not much of a threat to you and you only have one fleet - so I’m not worried about you coming after me by yourself. The wild card in all of this is Italy, and he’s only got one fleet over by me and a French unit in Piedmont.
