So here’s a plan, given we have to change things a little, and requires less of your time: Italy and Austria are at war, but E/G are working together, so we pivot this into a loosely coupled RAT alliance: Austria and I head against Italy, and you make sure to hold off the north, and Austria will help if Germany comes on land as well (I don’t think they will: France is hard enough, and Germany taking on France and Russia at the same time has... a lot of poor historical precedent).

Everyone else is talking about extremely short term arrangements. “Gunboat with a little bit of talking”, basically.  There is no FG alliance, it’s just that they’re both fighting England... for now.  It’s odd (to me).  I’m all for dynamic play, but you never get anywhere in this game if you only go it alone.

Well... that was harsh. Let me just put a few things straight. Me and Italy is not a thing. I communicated with them the first year about a potential mid game alliance, as I didn't want to be the only one fighting you and Austria. But if you look at their moves, we haven't really done any work together. We haven't even communicated in years. If you look at what they have done so far, you'll see that they are a.) a very bad player or/and b.) are not at all committed to the game. They have basically communicated with nobody, haven't really attacked anyone, and had a good amount of invalid orders. At this point it doesn't make any sense for me to communicate with Italy, since they are a bad player and are going downhill fast. An alliance with you would be much better.

Hey, so, Austria seems to want to Lepanto now.   You’re still the ally I want. And I’d like either to cut down Austria quickly or cut down Turkey quickly.

Hi Turkey, Hope you're doing well. I've been thinking about our game and how we can best win.

In terms of what I am telling Austria, I am definitely close with him, and I want him to feel like I’m not going to stab him, but we’re almost to the mid game, and cross board alliances work a lot better than neighbor alliances once we get to the mid-game, so I think you can be confident that you’re the long-term ally I want.

I would be willing to do that, but as I see it, you have no reason to choose France as an ally over me at this point. So, why me?

So my reasoning is that I think France is a stronger player than either of us, or at least a more engaged one. I'm getting all this tactical analysis and commentary about the state of the whole board and all that. If I help France, France probably beats me. If we defeat France together, I think we each end up with an even fighting chance.
