# diplomacy_translation
If you need to see how it works and play with it, you can check out the [demo](https://beta.openai.com/playground/p/sFjh0ESaFBAoftZlN0i00lHu?model=text-davinci-002). The following content is a Python API setup to use the model.
## Installation
```
git clone git@github.com:SiddarGu/diplomacy_translation.git
cd diplomacy_translation
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```
## Additional Setup
To get the app working, youâ€™ll need an API key. You can get one by [signing up](https://beta.openai.com/signup) for an account.
Next, create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your API key to it:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```
Note that OpenAI has a $18 free trial usage limit.


## Functions
```python
def toDAIDE(eng_msg: str, temperature=0, top_p=1, frequency_penalty=0, presence_penalty=0) -> str:
def toEnglish(daide_msg: str, temperature=0, top_p=1, frequency_penalty=0, presence_penalty=0) -> str:
```

## Usage
### Examples without changing hyperparameters
```python
from translation.translation import toDAIDE, toEnglish

daide_translation = toDAIDE("Can your army in Warsaw support my army in Ukraine?")
english_translation = toEnglish("PRP ((RUS FLT ION) CVY (TUR AMY TUN) CTO TRI)")
```
Each function also have some optional parameters, which can be used to change the hyperparameters of the translation.
- temperature (float): defaults to 1. Refers to what sampling temperature to use.
- top_p (float): defaults to 1. An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling.
- frequency_penalty (float between -2.0 and 2.0)
- presence_penalty=0 (float between -2.0 and 2.0)

See more info about these parameters [here](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/create)
### Advanced usage
```python
daide_translation = toDAIDE("Can your army in Warsaw support my army in Ukraine?", temperature=0.5)
```
